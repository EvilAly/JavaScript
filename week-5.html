        Week 5 - Scope & Closure

      /**
       * ===========================
       * Part 1: REQUIRED - 20 POINTS
       *
       * Overview:
       * Use closure to create a counter function. Every time the enclosed function is invoked,
       * the counter should increase by one. Print the output of the counter to the page.
       *
       * Instructions:
       *  - Create a parent function that contains a variable that tracks the current counter value. Start it at zero.
       *  - Create an enclosed (i.e. returned) function that increments the counter whenever it's invoked
       *      and prints the counter's current value to the page.
       *  - Outside the parent function, invoke it and capture its return value in a variable.
       *      (This returned value is what gets invoked to increase your counter's value)
       */

          count = count +1;

       * details private to outside code, closer can help you do that!
